   - Adjust smile position/size
   - Refine graph line smoothness
   - Adjust data point sizes
   - Fine-tune colors if needed

3. **Export**
   - Set artboard/canvas to 1024x1024px
   - Export as PNG
   - Ensure no transparency
   - Save as `icon.png`

### Option 2: Create from Scratch

**In Figma:**
1. Create 1024x1024px frame
2. Fill with cream background (#faf8f5)
3. Draw upward trending line (navy, 24px stroke, rounded caps)

## Testing at Small Sizes

After creating the icon, test it at these sizes to ensure readability:

- **60x60px** (Home screen icon size)
- **40x40px** (Settings/notifications)
- **29x29px** (Spotlight search)

**What to check:**
- Graph line is still visible
- Smile is recognizable
- Colors maintain contrast
- Overall shape is clear

## Alternative Variations

If the initial design needs adjustment:

1. **Simpler Version**: Remove grid lines, keep just graph line + smile
2. **Bolder Version**: Thicker graph line, larger smile
3. **Minimal Version**: Just graph line with smile, no data points
4. **Enhanced Version**: Add subtle gradient to graph line
